# Interactive Game Portfolio

<img src="docs/screenshot.png" alt="screenshot" width="100%" />

This is the repo for my interactive open world portfolio project. It is built with React Three Fiber and the Rapier physics engine. The goal is for users to walk around the map to find out different pieces of infermation about me.

# Storyline

This area needs work, but the idea right now is to keep it simple and just have a few NPC's someone can interact with to find out more information about you. I've listed these below but they need more information.

- Work experience (Sportsshoes, Money supermarket, Awaze)
- Personal - Love hiking, being in my van.
- Contact information
