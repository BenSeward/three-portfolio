# Storyline

This area needs work, but the idea right now is to keep it simple and just have a few NPC's someone can interact with to find out more information about you. I've listed these below but they need more information.

- Work experience (Sportsshoes, Money supermarket, Awaze)
- Personal - Love hiking, being in my van.
- Contact information
